# Voyayger-Series
Telescoping Truck Campers - A full hard side camper that fits in the back of a pickup truck, and raises in 3 sections to a height of 6, 7, or 8 feet. Because of this it has a Low Center of Gravity! Is light weight enough to stay install full time. And does Not obstruct your rear view!

# Model:
## LCV
a simple model that rases only, in 3 sections.
Our first model: "Voyager LCV" = Named for it's low center of gravity.

Has small drain channels along the perimiter for any water that seeps through the sliding rubber seals and collects or pools

## Outrigger
Unlike the simple model that has the entire mechanism on the Interior of the truck bed. The Outrigger "Fits Over" and envelopes the entire truck bed, creating some extra interior space on each side! It's sealing mechanism is also on better at sealing against Extreme Weather, Rain & Wind, since it's telescoping mechanism completely envelopes the truck bed!

This has a stronger & more expensive frame and side materials to account to be thin & stiff. We want it to petrude only a few centimeters around the truck bed. When installed will look almost like a cut down and lower "Utility & Commercial truck Box Bed" but with windows on side a half height door on back.

## Loft
Raises and then Slides out over the Cab creating a raised Bedding area! Requires much stronger design. More spaceous

## Psychomantium
A Highly conductive copper plated metal box with NO Windows! Operates as a mobile SCIF with Faraday cage.

# Option:
## Base

## Featherweight
Any of the other designs, but with the exterior be entirely Carbon Fiber! And Frame be Magnesium Alloy. Instead of our usual materials
